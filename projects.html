  <h1>PROJECTS </h1>
  <p><strong>Project 1: Create and submit a template for the CSS Zen Garden</strong><br />
    <em>Due: Thursday, February 19th</em></p>
  <p>Concept and design a CSS design for the CSS Zen Garden website using techniques learned in class. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Review the CSS Zen Garden website at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">http://www.csszengarden.com/</a></li>
    <li>Examine posted designs for inspiration.</li>
    <li>Download the XHTML and CSS templates from the CSS Zen Garden website .</li>
    <li>Build a complete design using CSS techniques learned in class.</li>
    <li>Upload your complete XHTML and CSS template to the CSS Zen Garden website.</li>
    <li>Add a link to your DMA442 website to the completed page on the CSS Zen Garden.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Project Requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All CSS must be accessed through an external style sheet only. Inline styling will not be accepted.</li>
    <li>All content must be positioned using CSS. Tables, &amp;nbsp, transparent .gifs or &lt;p&gt; used for positioning will not be accepted and will result in a grade deduction.</li>
    <li>Completed style sheets should change the look of CSS Zen garden significantly. A basic 4-color change with link styles is unacceptable. You are encouraged to use images; illustrations and textures to create a completely different look for the Zen Garden.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;All finished designed should have an overall concept associated with it. Remember, all finished designs will be critiqued and should stand strong against your peer&rsquo;s questions. Think about what your doing and why. Some questions to ask yourself- how would this particular design element fit into my overall concept? By adding this, does it make my concept stronger or weaker? Also, don&rsquo;t forget the importance of readability and usability.</li>
    <li>Your final page must validate in XHTML transistional. No Excuses! </li>
    <li>I will be checking the finished project in Firefox 3 and IE 7.</li>
    <li>All finished templates should be submitted by Thursday, February 19 before class. I will also collect your sketchbooks on the due date. If you have any questions or run into any problems, please talk to me <em>before </em>the final due date of the project. </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Remember to review the regulations posted on the CSS Zen Garden website.</strong>
  
  <p><strong>Project 2: Create a Database Driven Website using PHP and MySQL</strong><br/>
  <i>Due: Thursday, March 26th</i>
  <p>Concept and design a dynamic website with  database driven elements using PHP and MySQL. The website can be your personal website, a&nbsp; redesign of a website, or the creation of a new website. The completed design must be submitted  for peer review and critique.</p>
  
  Project Requirements:
  <ol>
  <li>The website must be at MINIMUM 10 pages.</li>
  <li>The website must use an external CSS style sheet</li>
  <li>The website must contain a dynamic contact form</li>
  <li>You must use PHP includes for the header and footer elements of the website. You should consider what elements will repeat from page to page- if it does, it must be included in the header or footer. A few example of what could be included in the header or footer are:<br />
    Header-<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ad banner<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logo<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breadcrumbs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last updated<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    Footer-<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designed by info</li>
  <li>You must design a logo for yourself or the organization chosen to place in the header of the website. </li>
  <li>All functionality needs to work. If anything is broken (ie- the submit button doesn&rsquo;t work) the you will received a significant deduction in the final project grade. There&rsquo;s no excuse! Test and retest your work.</li>
  <li>An element of or the completed site must be submitted for peer review. (EX: submit logo to logopond for review..) I will pass out a list in class of peer reviewed sites to submit your work to. </li>
  <li>All finished sites should be submitted by Thursday, February 19 before class. I will also collect your sketchbooks on the due date. If you have any questions or run into any problems, please talk to me <em>before </em>the final due date of the project. </li>
